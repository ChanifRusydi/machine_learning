   abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 - achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn.},

   abstract = {We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

@article{Ahmad2020,
   abstract = {<p> In the field of object detection, recently, tremendous success is achieved, but still it is a very challenging task to detect and identify objects accurately with fast speed. Human beings can detect and recognize multiple objects in images or videos with ease regardless of the object’s appearance, but for computers it is challenging to identify and distinguish between things. In this paper, a modified YOLOv1 based neural network is proposed for object detection. The new neural network model has been improved in the following ways. Firstly, modification is made to the loss function of the YOLOv1 network. The improved model replaces the margin style with proportion style. Compared to the old loss function, the new is more flexible and more reasonable in optimizing the network error. Secondly, a spatial pyramid pooling layer is added; thirdly, an inception model with a convolution kernel of 1  <math id="M1"> <mi>∗</mi> </math>  1 is added, which reduced the number of weight parameters of the layers. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC datasets 2007/2012 showed that the proposed method achieved better performance. </p>},

   abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

   abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Over the past two decades, we have seen a rapid technological evolution of object detection and its profound impact on the entire computer vision field. If we consider today's object detection technique as a revolution driven by deep learning, then, back in the 1990s, we would see the ingenious thinking and long-term perspective design of early computer vision. This article extensively reviews this fast-moving research field in the light of technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2022). A number of topics have been covered in this article, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speedup techniques, and recent state-of-the-art detection methods.},

   abstract = {In recent years, there has been a huge boom in the market in terms of both supply and demand for dashcams. This stems from the purpose of the camera installed in the vehicle. Dashcams are currently becoming an important aid in solving various adverse incidents, such as detecting violations of traffic regulations and other laws and recording and clarifying the course of a traffic accident or other criminologically relevant event. The purpose of this camera is to monitor the space in front and behind the vehicle, or the situation inside the vehicle. The content of this article is aimed at acquainting the reader with basic information about dashcams. Specifically, the individual parts of the article will discuss the importance and significance of the dashcams, the benefits of its use, and the legislative framework that regulates its use. The paper will conclude with a brief overview of innovative approaches based on the application of a dashcam for the purpose of increasing the level of safety of road users while driving a vehicle.},
